Leggie
======

Leggie is a pleasant, legible monospaced (character cell) bitmap font. It was
designed for readability and long work in a terminal. It's one of the very few
sans-serif monospace fonts. Leggie is available in 6x12 px. I think leggie is
more readable than Terminus at 12 px, because the letters are slightly shorter,
resulting in a bit more inter-line space (while still giving you the same number
of lines).

There is a good selection of glyphs available:

 - ASCII
 - ISO 8859-{1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9,10,13,14,15,16}
 - IPA
 - Microsoft WGL4
 - VT100 graphics
 - Common block drawing graphics
 - Symbols from the default VGA font (a.k.a. Codepage 437)
 - Some mathematics
 - Powerline
 - Nice punctuation
 - `ಠ_ಠ`

Overall, all living European languages are well-supported, including non-Latin
and non-Cyrillic scripts (Armenian an Hebrew). Vietnamese is also supported,
although the stacked diacritics might be a bit iffy.

I am always interested in adding new glyphs, so please let me know if there are
any characters/languages that you need and I will try to add them.
